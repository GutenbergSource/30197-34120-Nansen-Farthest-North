<HTML><BODY><h3>About the Author</h3>

<p><b>Fridtjof Nansen</b> (1861-1930) is one of the greatest Norwegians. He started his career as a zoologist. His fame started as an explorer of the Artic, of which the following book is one of his reports, but he continued to become a politician, professor, ambassador for his newly independent country, and, finally, a prominent diplomat, who, working with the league of nations managed to save countless lives. For this, he received the 1922 Nobel Peace Price. An extensive biography can be found on the <a href="http://nobelprize.org/peace/laureates/1922/nansen-bio.html">Nobel Commitee's Website</a>.

<h3>About this book</h3>

<p><i>Farthest North</i> (1897) First appeared in Norwegian under the title <i>Fram over Polhavet: Den norske polarfaerd, 1893-1896.</i> It was quickly translated (I've found references to German, English, French, Dutch, and Czech translations from the same year 1897). It relates the happenings on board the Fram during their three year journey through the ice. This is volume two of the two volume set. The second volume will follow in a separate project. A six volume set with the scientific results is also available (but I do not have a copy).

<p>Proofing should be straightforward. Lookout for the occasional accented letter and Norwegian word. Please leave pound signs, degree signs, etc. as they are (that is DO NOT spell them out)

<p>If anybody has access to copies of other works by Nansen, and wants to help scanning them, please contact the PM.
